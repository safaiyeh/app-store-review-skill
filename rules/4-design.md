# 4. DESIGN

## 4.1 Copycats

### 4.1(a) Original Ideas
- [ ] Create your own ideas
- [ ] Don't copy popular apps with minor changes
- [ ] Risk of IP infringement claims

### 4.1(b) Impersonation
- [ ] Submitting apps impersonating other apps/services violates Developer Code of Conduct
- [ ] May result in removal from Developer Program

### 4.1(c) Trademark and Brand Usage
- [ ] Cannot use another developer's icon, brand, or product name without approval

---

## 4.2 Minimum Functionality

Apps should include features, content, and UI elevating it beyond a repackaged website.

**React Native - WebView-only apps will be REJECTED:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Pure WebView wrapper (REJECTION)
const App = () => (
  <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://mywebsite.com' }} />
);

// ❌ BAD: WebView with minimal native chrome
const App = () => (
  <SafeAreaView>
    <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://mywebsite.com' }} />
  </SafeAreaView>
);

// ✅ GOOD: Hybrid app with native features
const App = () => (
  <NavigationContainer>
    <Tab.Navigator>
      <Tab.Screen name="Home" component={NativeHomeScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Profile" component={NativeProfileScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="WebContent" component={WebViewScreen} />
    </Tab.Navigator>
  </NavigationContainer>
);

// ✅ GOOD: WebView with significant native functionality
const App = () => {
  // Native features that justify the app
  const { pushToken } = usePushNotifications();
  const { biometricAuth } = useBiometrics();
  const { offlineData } = useOfflineStorage();

  return (
    <View>
      <NativeHeader />
      <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://mywebsite.com' }} />
      <NativeTabBar />
    </View>
  );

- [ ] Alternative marketplace with marketplace-specific login
- [ ] Education/enterprise app requiring existing accounts
- [ ] Government/industry citizen identification system
- [ ] Client for specific third-party service requiring direct sign-in

**Swift implementation:**
```swift
// REQUIRED: If using social login, also offer alternative
class LoginViewController {
    @IBAction func signInWithApple() {
        // Sign in with Apple (recommended alternative)
    }

    @IBAction func signInWithGoogle() {
        // Third-party login
    }

    @IBAction func signInWithEmail() {
        // Email-only alternative (name + email only)
    }
}
```

**React Native implementation:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: If using social login, must offer Sign in with Apple
import { appleAuth } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';
import { GoogleSignin } from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';

const LoginScreen = () => {
  // ✅ REQUIRED: Sign in with Apple (if any social login is offered)
  const signInWithApple = async () => {
    const credential = await appleAuth.performRequest({
      requestedOperation: appleAuth.Operation.LOGIN,
      requestedScopes: [appleAuth.Scope.EMAIL, appleAuth.Scope.FULL_NAME],
    });
    // User can hide their email - respect this!
    const { email, fullName } = credential;
    await authenticateWithBackend(credential);
  };

  // Third-party login
  const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
    await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices();
    const userInfo = await GoogleSignin.signIn();
    await authenticateWithBackend(userInfo);
  };

  // Email-only alternative (collects only name + email)
  const signInWithEmail = async (email: string, name: string) => {
    await authenticateWithBackend({ email, name });
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* If you have Google login, you MUST have Apple login */}
      <AppleButton onPress={signInWithApple} />
      <GoogleSigninButton onPress={signInWithGoogle} />
      <Button title="Continue with Email" onPress={showEmailForm} />
    </View>
  );
};

// Packages needed:
// - @invertase/react-native-apple-authentication
// - @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
```

## Practical Review Considerations (Unofficial)

> **Note:** The following are not official App Store Review Guidelines but are important practical considerations based on how Apple reviews apps.

### iPad Responsiveness

Apple reviewers frequently test apps on iPads, even for iPhone-only apps. Your app must be responsive and functional on iPad to avoid rejection.

- [ ] Test your app on iPad simulator before submission
- [ ] Ensure layouts don't break on larger screens
- [ ] UI elements should be appropriately sized and positioned
- [ ] Navigation should work correctly on iPad
- [ ] Modal presentations should display properly

**React Native implementation:**
```typescript
import { useWindowDimensions, Platform } from 'react-native';

// ✅ GOOD: Responsive design that works on iPad
const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const { width, height } = useWindowDimensions();
  const isTablet = width >= 768;

  return (
    <View style={[
      styles.container,
      isTablet && styles.tabletContainer
    ]}>
      {/* Adapt layout based on screen size */}
    </View>
  );
};

// ✅ GOOD: Check if running on iPad
const isIPad = Platform.OS === 'ios' && Platform.isPad;

// ✅ GOOD: Use flex layouts that adapt to screen size
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 16,
  },
  tabletContainer: {
    paddingHorizontal: 48,
    maxWidth: 800,
    alignSelf: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Expo considerations:**
```typescript
import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

// Check device type in Expo
const deviceType = Constants.deviceType;
// 1 = Phone, 2 = Tablet, 3 = Desktop
```

**Swift implementation:**
```swift
import UIKit

// ✅ GOOD: Check if running on iPad
let isIPad = UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == .pad

// ✅ GOOD: Adaptive layouts using size classes
class ResponsiveViewController: UIViewController {
    override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {
        super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)
        updateLayoutForCurrentTraitCollection()
    }

    private func updateLayoutForCurrentTraitCollection() {
        if traitCollection.horizontalSizeClass == .regular {
            // iPad or large screen layout
            configureTabletLayout()
        } else {
            // iPhone or compact layout
            configurePhoneLayout()
        }
    }

    private func configureTabletLayout() {
        // Wider margins, larger touch targets, split views
    }

    private func configurePhoneLayout() {
        // Standard phone layout
    }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Using Auto Layout constraints that adapt
class AdaptiveView: UIView {
    private func setupConstraints() {
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            // Use readable content guide for text on iPad
            contentView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: readableContentGuide.leadingAnchor),
            contentView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: readableContentGuide.trailingAnchor),
        ])
    }
}

// ✅ GOOD: SwiftUI adaptive layout
import SwiftUI

struct ResponsiveView: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass

    var body: some View {
        if horizontalSizeClass == .regular {
            // iPad layout
            HStack {
                SidebarView()
                ContentView()
            }
        } else {
            // iPhone layout
            NavigationStack {
                ContentView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
