description: App Store Review Guidelines Section 1 - Safety (objectionable content, UGC, Kids Category, physical harm, data security)
---

# 1. SAFETY

Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.

## 1.1 Objectionable Content

### 1.1.1 Defamatory, Discriminatory, or Mean-Spirited Content

**REJECT if app contains:**
- [ ] Content including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups
- [ ] Content likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group
- [ ] Discriminatory language in any text, assets, or user-facing content

**Exception:** Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt.

**Code patterns to flag:**

```swift
// Swift - FLAG: Review all hardcoded strings for discriminatory content
let strings = ["message", "alert", "notification"] // Audit for offensive language

// FLAG: User-facing text that targets groups
// Search for terms related to: religion, race, gender, nationality, orientation
```

```typescript
// React Native - FLAG: Review all hardcoded strings
const strings = {
  message: "...", // Audit for offensive language
  alert: "...",
};

// FLAG: Check i18n/localization files for discriminatory content
// en.json, es.json, etc.
```

### 1.1.2 Realistic Portrayals of Violence

**REJECT if app contains:**
- [ ] Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused
- [ ] Content that encourages violence
- [ ] "Enemies" that solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity

**Code patterns to flag:**

```swift
// Swift - FLAG: Violence-related asset names
"kill_", "death_", "blood_", "gore_", "torture_", "maim_"
```

```typescript
// React Native - FLAG: Violence-related assets
import killIcon from './assets/kill_enemy.png'; // REVIEW
import deathAnimation from './assets/death.json'; // REVIEW

// FLAG: Enemy targeting specific real groups
type EnemyType = 'specificNationality' | 'specificReligion'; // REJECTION RISK
```

### 1.1.3 Weapons and Dangerous Objects

**REJECT if app:**
- [ ] Depicts content encouraging illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects
- [ ] Facilitates the purchase of firearms or ammunition

**Code patterns to flag:**

```swift
// Swift - FLAG: Weapon purchase functionality
func purchaseFirearm()
func buyAmmunition()

// FLAG: Links to weapon retailers
"gunbroker.com", "ammo.com"
```

```typescript
// React Native - FLAG: Weapon purchase functionality
const purchaseFirearm = async () => { }; // REJECTION
const buyAmmunition = async () => { }; // REJECTION

// FLAG: Links to weapon retailers
Linking.openURL('https://gunbroker.com'); // REJECTION
```

### 1.1.4 Overtly Sexual or Pornographic Material

**REJECT if app contains:**
- [ ] Explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings
- [ ] "Hookup" apps that may include pornography
- [ ] Content that could facilitate prostitution or human trafficking/exploitation

**Code patterns to flag:**

```swift
// Swift - FLAG: Adult content indicators
"nsfw", "adult_content", "explicit", "xxx"

// FLAG: Dating/hookup functionality without moderation
func matchUsers() // Ensure proper moderation exists
```

```typescript
// React Native - FLAG: Adult content indicators
const isNSFW = true; // REVIEW
const contentRating = 'explicit'; // REVIEW

// FLAG: Dating/hookup functionality without moderation
const matchUsers = async () => { }; // Ensure moderation exists
```

### 1.1.5 Inflammatory Religious Commentary

**REJECT if app contains:**
- [ ] Inflammatory religious commentary
- [ ] Inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts

### 1.1.6 False Information and Features

**REJECT if app:**
- [ ] Provides inaccurate device data
- [ ] Contains trick/joke functionality (e.g., fake location trackers)
- [ ] Enables anonymous or prank phone calls or SMS/MMS messaging

**Note:** Stating "for entertainment purposes" does NOT overcome this guideline.

**Code patterns to flag:**

```swift
// Swift - FLAG: Fake device data
func getFakeLocation() -> CLLocation // REJECTION
func spoofDeviceID() -> String // REJECTION

// FLAG: Prank call/SMS functionality
func makeAnonymousCall() // REJECTION
func sendPrankSMS() // REJECTION
```

```typescript
// React Native - FLAG: Fake device data
const getFakeLocation = (): Location => { }; // REJECTION
const spoofDeviceID = (): string => { }; // REJECTION

// FLAG: Using react-native-device-info to spoof
import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';
const fakeId = 'spoofed-id'; // Don't return fake data

// FLAG: Prank functionality
const makeAnonymousCall = () => { }; // REJECTION
const sendPrankSMS = () => { }; // REJECTION
```

### 1.1.7 Harmful Concepts Exploiting Current Events

**REJECT if app:**
- [ ] Capitalizes or seeks to profit on violent conflicts
- [ ] Exploits terrorist attacks
- [ ] Exploits epidemics or health crises

---

## 1.2 User-Generated Content

Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with UGC or social networking services MUST include:

### Required UGC Features (ALL MANDATORY)

- [ ] **Content Filtering:** A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted
- [ ] **Reporting Mechanism:** A way to report offensive content with timely responses
- [ ] **User Blocking:** The ability to block abusive users from the service
- [ ] **Contact Information:** Published contact information so users can easily reach you

**Swift implementation:**
```swift
// REQUIRED: Content filtering
protocol ContentFilter {
    func filterContent(_ content: String) -> FilterResult
    func moderateImage(_ image: UIImage) -> ModerationResult
}

// REQUIRED: Report mechanism
func reportContent(
    contentId: String,
    reason: ReportReason,
    additionalInfo: String?
) async throws

// REQUIRED: Block user
func blockUser(_ userId: String) async throws
func getBlockedUsers() -> [User]

// REQUIRED: Support contact
var supportEmail: String { get }
var supportURL: URL { get }
```

**React Native implementation:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Content filtering
interface ContentFilter {
  filterContent(content: string): Promise<FilterResult>;
  moderateImage(imageUri: string): Promise<ModerationResult>;
}

// Example using a moderation API
const filterContent = async (content: string): Promise<FilterResult> => {
  // Use a service like OpenAI Moderation, Perspective API, or custom ML
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/moderate', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ content }),
  });
  return response.json();
};

// REQUIRED: Report mechanism
const reportContent = async (
  contentId: string,
  reason: ReportReason,
  additionalInfo?: string
): Promise<void> => {
  await api.post('/reports', { contentId, reason, additionalInfo });
};

// REQUIRED: Block user
const blockUser = async (userId: string): Promise<void> => {
  await api.post(`/users/${userId}/block`);
};

const getBlockedUsers = async (): Promise<User[]> => {
  return api.get('/users/blocked');
};

// REQUIRED: Support contact - expose in app
const SUPPORT_EMAIL = 'support@example.com';
const SUPPORT_URL = 'https://example.com/support';
```

### Content That Results in Removal

Apps primarily used for the following will be removed WITHOUT notice:
- Pornographic content
- Chatroulette-style experiences
- Random or anonymous chat
- Objectification of real people (e.g., "hot-or-not" voting)
- Making physical threats
- Bullying

### Incidental Mature "NSFW" Content

If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service:
- [ ] Mature content MUST be hidden by default
- [ ] Only displayed when user explicitly enables it via your website

```typescript
// React Native - REQUIRED: NSFW content hidden by default
const [showMatureContent, setShowMatureContent] = useState(false);

// Must be enabled via website, not in-app toggle for Kids safety
// Check user preference from backend (set via website)
useEffect(() => {
  const checkMatureContentSetting = async () => {
    const setting = await api.get('/user/settings/mature-content');
    setShowMatureContent(setting.enabled); // Set via website only
  };
  checkMatureContentSetting();
}, []);
```

### 1.2.1 Creator Content

Apps featuring content from "creators" must:
- [ ] Properly moderate content per Guideline 1.2
- [ ] Follow payment guidelines per 3.1.1
- [ ] Communicate which content requires additional purchases
- [ ] Not change core features/functionality of native app

#### 1.2.1(a) Age Rating and Access Restrictions

- [ ] Provide way for users to identify content exceeding app's age rating
- [ ] Use age restriction mechanism based on verified or declared age
- [ ] Limit access by underage users to age-inappropriate content

## 1.3 Kids Category

If participating in Kids Category, you MUST follow these rules:

### Core Requirements

- [ ] No links out of app unless behind parental gate
- [ ] No purchasing opportunities unless behind parental gate
- [ ] No other distractions to kids unless behind parental gate
- [ ] Must continue meeting Kids Category requirements in all future updates

**Swift parental gate:**
```swift
// REQUIRED: Parental gate for Kids apps
class ParentalGate {
    // Must require adult verification - examples:
    // - Math problem (e.g., "What is 15 + 27?")
    // - Date of birth entry
    // - Written instructions to have parent complete

    func presentGate(completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
        // Implementation must be non-trivial for children
    }
}

// REQUIRED: Gate before external links
func openExternalLink(_ url: URL) {
    parentalGate.presentGate { verified in
        if verified {
            UIApplication.shared.open(url)
        }
    }
}

// REQUIRED: Gate before purchases
func initiatePurchase(_ product: SKProduct) {
    parentalGate.presentGate { verified in
        if verified {
            // Proceed with purchase
        }
    }
}
```

**React Native parental gate:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Parental gate for Kids apps
import { Linking } from 'react-native';

interface ParentalGateProps {
  onVerified: () => void;
  onCancelled: () => void;
}

const ParentalGate: React.FC<ParentalGateProps> = ({ onVerified, onCancelled }) => {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');

  // Must be non-trivial for children
  const correctAnswer = 15 + 27; // = 42

  const verify = () => {
    if (parseInt(answer) === correctAnswer) {
      onVerified();
    }
  };

  return (
    <Modal>
      <Text>For grown-ups only!</Text>
      <Text>What is 15 + 27?</Text>
      <TextInput
        keyboardType="numeric"
        value={answer}
        onChangeText={setAnswer}
      />
      <Button title="Submit" onPress={verify} />
      <Button title="Cancel" onPress={onCancelled} />
    </Modal>
  );
};

// REQUIRED: Gate before external links
const openExternalLink = async (url: string) => {
  const verified = await showParentalGate();
  if (verified) {
    Linking.openURL(url);
  }
};

// REQUIRED: Gate before purchases (using react-native-iap)
import * as IAP from 'react-native-iap';

const initiatePurchase = async (sku: string) => {
  const verified = await showParentalGate();
  if (verified) {
    await IAP.requestPurchase({ sku });
  }
};
```

const measureBloodPressure = async () => { }; // REJECTION without hardware
const measureBloodGlucose = async () => { };  // REJECTION without hardware
const measureBloodOxygen = async () => { };   // REJECTION without hardware
const measureTemperature = async () => { };   // REJECTION without hardware

// REQUIRED: Medical disclaimer
const MEDICAL_DISCLAIMER = `

**Swift implementation:**
```swift
// REQUIRED: Secure data storage
import Security

class SecureStorage {
    // Use Keychain for sensitive data
    func storeCredential(_ credential: String, for key: String) throws {
        let query: [String: Any] = [
            kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
            kSecAttrAccount as String: key,
            kSecValueData as String: credential.data(using: .utf8)!
        ]
        SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
    }
}

// REQUIRED: HTTPS for network communications
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.tlsMinimumSupportedProtocolVersion = .TLSv12

// BAD: Hardcoded secrets
let apiKey = "sk_live_xxxxx" // NEVER DO THIS
let password = "admin123"    // NEVER DO THIS

// GOOD: Environment/secure storage
let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["API_KEY"]
let apiKey = try SecureStorage.shared.retrieveCredential(for: "api_key")
```

**React Native implementation:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Secure data storage
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';
import EncryptedStorage from 'react-native-encrypted-storage';

// Use Keychain for credentials
const storeCredential = async (key: string, value: string) => {
  await Keychain.setGenericPassword(key, value);
};

const getCredential = async (key: string) => {
  const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword();
  return credentials ? credentials.password : null;
};

// Use EncryptedStorage for other sensitive data
const storeSecureData = async (key: string, value: string) => {

};

// ❌ BAD: Hardcoded secrets
const API_KEY = 'sk_live_xxxxx'; // NEVER DO THIS
const PASSWORD = 'admin123';     // NEVER DO THIS

// ❌ BAD: Secrets in JavaScript bundle
// .env files get bundled into JS - use native modules for secrets

// ✅ GOOD: Use react-native-config with native-side secrets
import Config from 'react-native-config';
const apiKey = Config.API_KEY; // Set in native build, not JS

// ✅ GOOD: Fetch secrets from secure backend
const getApiKey = async () => {
  const response = await secureApi.get('/config/api-key');
  return response.data.key;
};

// REQUIRED: HTTPS for all network requests
// Ensure no HTTP endpoints in your app
// Check fetch() calls, axios baseURL, etc.
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com', // Must be HTTPS
});

// Enable SSL pinning for sensitive apps
import { fetch } from 'react-native-ssl-pinning';
```
